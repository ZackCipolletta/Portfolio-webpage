# Portfolio Webpage

#### By Zachary Cipolletta

#### This is a landing page for my programming portfolio

## Technologies used

* HTML

## Description

This is a basic webpage which will act as a landing page for my programming portfolio.  It will be updated as I create more complicated and dynamic projects.  I will link my corresponding GitHub repos and pages here along with a brief description of each project.

##

* Clone repository to your desktop
* Open with VS code or other text editor
* Alternatively you may wish to havigate to the GitHub pages version --> https://zackcipolletta.github.io/Portfolio-webpage/

## Known Bugs
 * At this time I would like to update the skills section to be centered and automatically float as the page is resized.  I would also like to find a better background image and color scheme to make the page more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
